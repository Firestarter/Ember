Ember is essentially the core for Firestarter proxies! Ember includes many commands that are accessible network-wide, such as /discord, /vote, etc. and other useful custom utilities, and runs on Bungeecord!

Ember depends on [Kerosene](https://github.com/FirestarterMC/Kerosene), which is our package of essential dependencies shared across many plugins.

Feel free to have a look at the code and modify it for your own purposes as you wish! ✨
